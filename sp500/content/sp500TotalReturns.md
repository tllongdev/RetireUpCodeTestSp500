### S&P Total Returns

The total returns of the S&P 500 index are listed by year. Total returns include two components: the
return generated by dividends and the return generated by price changes in the index. While most
individuals focus only on the price returns of the index, dividends play an important factor in
overall investment returns. Adjust the range slider to a desired start year and end year to view
cumulative returns from the specified start year.
